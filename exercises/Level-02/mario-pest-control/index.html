                                    Goombas resemble small brown mushrooms and are a fungus-based species like Toads, Amanitas, Spooks, and Shroobs. Goombas are physically weak and are not much of a threat to Mario or Luigi, since a single stomp usually defeats them, although a number of different Goomba variants have emerged throughout the years; however, they do drop hints of being much stronger and more competent than their appearances suggest, as in 	the case of Captain Goomba. The Goombas, as a collective race, used to be allied with the Mushroom Kingdom. However, most of the Goombas have turned traitorous and joined the Koopa Troop, an organization led by 	Bowser. In many games, Goombas are the first enemy the player meets. Goombas have two feet and no visible arms.

                                    However, not all Goombas are allied with Bowser or the Koopa Troop. Some Goombas, such as the inhabitants of Goomba Village, live peacefully inside the borders of the Mushroom Kingdom, while others simply hold no allegiance and operate independently in distant locales such as Monstro Town and Rogueport.

                                    Bob-ombs are living, moving mechanical bombs with eyes, feet, and a wind-up key on the back. They are generic enemies who first appeared in Super Mario Bros. 2 and have appeared in nearly every Mario game since then. Their appearance, intelligence, and status in relation to Mario differ widely from game to game. They are usually either blue or black, but some variations are pink or red. They also flash red and sometimes make beeping sounds if they are about to explode.

                                    There are many different species of Cheep-Cheeps, and they come in different colors, including yellow and green. The most common ones, however, are red with a white patch on their stomach, a yellow (originally white) tail fin, a mohawk-like dorsal fin and wing-like fins. They also have blue eyes and pink lips. Cheep-Cheeps have fins shaped like wings and may attack above the surface of the water by jumping out in an arc. Given this, Cheep-Cheeps seem to be inspired by flying fish, hence the wing-like fins, which behave similarly. Most Cheep-Cheeps appear to be affiliated with Bowser and the Koopa Troop, while others, such as the ones seen in Super Paper Mario, are not. In most of the games they are in, Cheep-Cheeps possess a wide 	variety of attacks, typically regarding jumping behavior.
