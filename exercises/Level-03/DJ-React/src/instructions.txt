REQUIREMENTS

your DJ Color board will use smaller buttons to make your grid of four squares change colors. 

This is a great time to practice CSS Grids. Create four squares in a two by two grid that will change 
color depending on where you are as a DJ. A master DJ will use 8 buttons. 

Entry level of advancement will use previous levels of requirements, and add to them. 

You will have a parent component that will contain the four squares. This parent component's 
state will maintain an array of colors. 

        ["white", "white", "white", "white"];


You can then render your squares like this: 

        <Square color={colors[0]}/>
        <Square color={colors[1]}/>
        <Square color={colors[2]}/>
        <Square color={colors[3]}/>

or better yet, write a .map() to render these. 


The Modes:

    Small Time DJ: 
        You will have one button that will change all four squares either black or white. White if the first one
        is not white. Black if the first is white. 

    Party DJ:
        Add a second button. The second button will turn the top half (both squares) of the grid purple. 
    
    Professional DJ:
        Add two more buttons, for a total of four. These next two will change the colors of the bottom 
        squares blue, but indivisually. One will be linked to the bottom left, and the other to the bottom
        right. 

    Big Time DJ:
        Your next four buttons will each be linked to one of the squares. These buttons can have any effect 
        on those squares that you wish.

    One of the Greats:
        Your buttons will play sounds.
