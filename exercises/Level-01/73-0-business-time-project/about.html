                Hello, everyone! So here is a little about me that you mighty wanna know and be able to beleive in as I do in myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Yale University, from studying design with an emphasis in digital Photography. I have had an artistic eye ever since I was a little kid, and this in the only thing that I ever wanted to do in life. Once I had graduated I was lucky enough to be able to work under a professional. They were nice enough to mold my talents and skills in the apporpriate direction to become the Photographer that I am today. For the last 4 years I have been handling things on  my own to start to seperate myself from my boss, as I was intending on starting up my own business as my boss was in the stages of retiring herself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am starting my photography in wedding, engagements, portraits, and families to start with possibilities of refining that smaller later but starting to see what people in the area are really wanting.
